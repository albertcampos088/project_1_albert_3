<p>The VMP is a fully automatic Sub Machine Gun in Black Ops 3. The weapon has a very high rate of fire which makes it a popular go to weapon for rushing and fast paced playing styles.

The VMP can kill in 4 to 5 shots which isn't the strongest. However its fast fire rate makes up for it and it is one of the more popular SMG's in the game. Plus it has a decent size clip which also compensates for the fast fire rate.

Recommended Attachments for the VMP are Long Barrel, Grip and Quickdraw.
