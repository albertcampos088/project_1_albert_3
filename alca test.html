<p>The ICR is a fully automatic Assault Rifle in Black Ops 3. The weapons accuracy is it's best attribute and the weapon is very easy to fire on target. However, the ICR's damage is not great and is in fact the lowest among the assault rifles.

The ICR is best used in medium to long range engagements and is not recommended for close range gun fights. You will most definitely lose against an SMG or Pistol.

Recommended Attachments for the ICR-1 are the Long Barrel, Quickdraw and Stock. We also recommend an Optical Attachment like the Reflex or ELO because the Iron Sights tends to be cluttered.
